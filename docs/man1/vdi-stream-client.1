.TH VDI-STREAM-CLIENT 1 2021-01-26 "VDI Stream Client" "multimedia"
.SH NAME
vdi-stream-client \- a low latency desktop streaming client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vdi-stream-client
[\fI\-\-session\fP <id>] [\fI\-\-peer\fP <id>] [\fIoptions\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
VDI Stream Client is a tiny and low latency Linux client which connects
to Parsec Host running on Windows. It allows to run fully GPU accelerated
Windows desktop environment on a remote machine while streaming the
content to a local Linux system which process keyboard and mouse input.
The remote server can be a virtual machine running on-top of on-premise
deployments of Virtuozzo Hybrid Server, KVM or Xen. It can also connect
to public clouds like Amazon (EC2 G3 Accelerated) or Microsoft Azure
(NV6). It uses Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2) for low-level access to
audio, video, keyboard, mouse and clipboard.
.SH OPTIONS
Help options:
.TP 8
.B  \-h|\-\-help
.ti 15
Print the usage message on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B  \-v|\-\-version
.ti 15
Print the currently installed version on the standard output.
.PP
Parsec options:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-session <\fIid\fP>
.ti 15
The session ID to connect to Parsec service. This option is mandatory.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-peer <\fIid\fP>
.ti 15
The peer ID of the remote Parsec host. This option is mandatory.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-timeout <\fIseconds\fP>
.ti 15
The connection timeout when first connection to host is established.
There will be no reconnect in this case. The default timeout is 5
seconds.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-codec <\fIh264\fP> | <\fIh265\fP>
.ti 15
The streaming codec to use, supported codecs are h264 and h265. There
is a trade-off between CPU performance and network latency and
bandwidth consumption. When using h264 the CPU load and network latency
is lower while more network bandwidth is consumed. When using h265 -
even in case of GPU decoding - CPU load and network latency is higher
while network bandwidth is reduced. The default codec is h264.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-mode <\fI4:2:0\fP> | <\fI4:4:4\fP>
.ti 15
The color mode to use, supported modes are 4:2:0 and 4:4:4. The color
mode 4:4:4 is a paid feature under Parsec Warp subscription and due to
a bug in Parsec SDK it is currently not working. The default is 4:2.0.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-speed <\fIspeed\fP>
.ti 15
The mouse wheel snesitivity to use, supported range is between 0
(disable mouse wheel completely) up to 500. The value is in pixel. The
default value is 100.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-width <\fIwidth\fP>
.ti 15
The host screen and window width to use. The host will change
resolution either to specified value or - if not supported - to closest
one which matches. If not used, the client will resize window to current
configured host width. The value is in pixel.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-height <\fIheight\fP>
.ti 15
The host screen and window height to use. The host will change
resolution either to specified value or - if not supported - to closest
one which matches. If not used, the client will resize window to current
configured host height. The value is in pixel.
.PP
Client options:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-no\-acceleration
.ti 15
Disable hardware accelerated client decoding. If disabled, client will
decode frames in software on CPU. If enabled, client will decode frames
acclerated with the help of GPU. In both cases frames are rendered with
OpenGL. With software implementation it is almost impossible to reach
smooth client rendering. It is enabled by default.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-no\-upnp
.ti 15
Disable UPnP NAT traversal support. If disabled, client may not be
able to connect to host. If enabled, client will use UPnP to assist
NAT traversal. It is not recommended to turn it off due to UDP
client listening. It is enabled by default.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-no\-reconnect
.ti 15
Disable automatic reconnect in case of network or service failures. If
disabled, client will immediately terminate on failures. If enabled a
black window with text "Reconnecting..." is shown in case of failures.
It is recommended to leave it enabled if you are on roaming or an
unstable and slow network link. It is enabled by default.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-no\-grab
.ti 15
Disable exclusive mouse grab. If disabled, the mouse is passive grabbed
and can enter and leave the window when mouse is moved. If enabled, the
first press of any mouse button will lock the mouse into the window. To
release the mouse  grab you need to press "Ctrl+Alt". It is enabled by
default.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-no\-screensaver
.ti 15
Disable screen saver and screen locker support on client machine (Linux
X11). If disabled, configured X11 screen saver and lockers are ignored
and X11 will never start them. This applies only to screen savers and
lockers using the X11 API. If enabled, X11 screen saver and lockers will
work as usual. It is enabled by default.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-no\-clipboard
.ti 15
Disable clipboard sharing between client and host. If disabled, the
clipboards of client and host are independent and never synchronized. It
helps to avoid occasional leaks of sensitive information made by copy
and paste mistakes. If enabled, both clipboards are always synchronized
in bi-directional mode. It is enabled by default.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-no\-audio
.ti 15
Disable audio streaming support. If disabled, no audio from host is
streamed and played on client machine. If enabled, audio is streamed
and played with default audio device used by SDL. It is enabled by
default.
